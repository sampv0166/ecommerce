react is a single page based framework , browser initially reads index.html file
index.html contains a div with the id "root"
index.js contains the app compponent , and the render method puts it into the root element
change title and metadata of the index.html file
change the favicon
delete app.css
delete app.tests.js
delete logo.svg
delete setuptests.js

these days its common to use functional components with hooks, there are also class based components
JSX - we can have html css and javascript togather 
the return has to be a single element (div or fragment)

USE GIT AS VERSION CONTROL SO THAT WE CAN TRACK THE PROGRESS

git commands 
-------------
ls  = will list all the folder contents
git init = initialize empty git repository
git add. = add everything to the repository
git status =  we can list everything that is in the staging area
git commit -m 'commit description' = commits all staged changes


.gitignore file allows you to describe the files that u dont want to push to the repository
add .env to gitignore , because it can contain sensitive information like paypal key or mongoose


terminal commmands
--------------------
cd.. = to go back in directory

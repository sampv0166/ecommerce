Redux is for having a global state for the application

the way state is changed through reducer or reducer functions 
reducers are basically just functions that accept actions and they are responsible for manipulating and passing the state down to components.
actions are just objects that represnts the intention to change a piece of state. 
we also have action creators which are functions that will dispatch or fire off these actions div
we may have an action creator called GET PRODUCTS , IN THAT , WE MAKE A FETCH REQUEST TO THE BACKEND .
AND THEN WE DISPACTH THE ACTIONS TO THE REDUCERS AND WE ATTACH A PAYLOAD TO IT ,THAT PAYLOAD WILL HAVE THE FETCED DATA  
IN THE REDCUER WE CAN ASSIGN THAT PAYLOAD DATA TO THE STATE AND PASS IT DOWN TO ANY COMPONENT THAT ASKS FOR IT . 
SO THAT WE CAN HABE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS THAT ASK THE SAME PIECEOF STATE 


npm i redux react-redux redux-thunk redux-devtools-extension


redux-thunk allows us to make asynchronous requests to the server from action creators . 



start with the constants folder and create the action name constant and export them
go to the corresponding reducer 
whenever we add a new reducer we need tio bring to our store.js file 

next step is to creare an action to make request to the api 

go to screen folder of and select the corresponding component that we want to load the data into
